Homework with Git
Starting today, and for the duration of your cohort, you will use git to submit all of your homework and classwork assignments. All homework assignments will be accumulated into a single repo on GitHub. Each day's homework will be done in a local copy and pushed up to GitHub daily.

The homework for the day should be submitted before 9 AM of the day in question. Homework scheduled for W1D5 needs to be submitted on W1D5 before 9 AM.
